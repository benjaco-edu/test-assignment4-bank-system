## Modification

The code for get discount has been places in the customer class instead, it is because the discount issn't tired to a creditcard, but an account instead, and the customerclass is the responsible class to create an account

The csv tests do not test the date where the discount runs out, moch the date is for the next assigment.

My expansion of the system is to generate a welcome message in the atm class, it has been tested with multiple balances in a parameterized test
